  <p>Poultry have been on the earth for over 150 million years, dating back to the original wild jungle fowl Now we
include ducks, geese, turkeys, pheasants, pigeons, peafowl, guinea fowl and chickens in the list of species under
the general term poultry.
Poultry provide humans with companionship, food and fiber in the form of eggs, meat and feathers. Many
people love to raise and show chickens and other poultry species at fairs and other poultry shows. Others just
love to raise them for backyard pets and for fresh eggs every day. There is a large commercial chicken industry
that provides us with eggs and meat.
The commercial egg laying industry is comprised of over 273 million laying hens, of which about 237 million
produce table eggs (the eggs you buy at the supermarket) and the rest were for fertile hatching eggs as
replacement for the laying flocks. In 1991 the United States produced about 5.7 billion dozen eggs. Connecticut
is a small state and has about 3.6 million laying hens.”</p>

    <p>The poultry meat industry is comprised of the broiler and turkey industries. In 1991 there were 6.1 billion
broilers processed in the United States. This represents about 19.7 billion pounds of ready-to-cook broiler meat.
Per capita consumption of broiler meat was at about 70 lbs. in 1991. Turkey productions was at about 276
million in 1991 which represents about 4.6 billion pounds or about 18 lbs. Per person consumed. In Connecticut
about 10,000 broilers and about 35,000 turkeys were raised in 1991.</p>

  <p>Global consumption of poultry products, especially poultry meat,
has consistently increased over the years, and this trend is expected to continue. Much of the increase in global demand for
poultry products will be in developing countries. Such growth in
the poultry industry is having a profound effect on the demand
for feed and raw materials. However, it is also becoming clear
that the requirements for the four traditional feed ingredients –
maize, soybean meal, fishmeal and meat meal – cannot be met,
even according to optimistic forecasts. The gap between local
supply and demand for these traditional ingredients is expected
to widen over the coming decades, providing a compelling reason
for exploring the usefulness of locally available, alternative feedstuffs in feed formulations. </p>

  <p>A wide range of alternative feedstuffs are available for feeding
in all three poultry production systems. The greatest potential for
efficiently utilizing these feedstuffs will be in traditional family
poultry systems (scavenging and backyard) and the semi-commercial system. In the semi-commercial system, only part of the
feed requirement is purchased from commercial compounders, so
there is opportunity for on-farm mixing or dilution of purchased
feeds with locally available, alternative feedstuffs. In low-input
family poultry systems, locally available, alternative feedstuffs can
be used to supplement the scavenging feed base.</p>
